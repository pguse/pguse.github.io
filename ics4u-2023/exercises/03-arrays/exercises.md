# Arrays

## Exercises

## 03-0: Student Average

1.  Create a folder called **StudentAverageArrays**.  Create a C# program that stores and averages 8 marks in an integer array.  The marks will be input by the user.
2.  Calculate the average, by using a **for-loop**.  ***Note:  You will need to use the idea of using an accumulator that we used in grade 11 with Python.***
3.  Output both the marks ***(all on one line)*** and the average, as shown in the example below.

```
Mark #1: 72
Mark #2: 85
Mark #3: 67
Mark #4: 78
Mark #5: 90
Mark #6: 81
Mark #7: 87
Mark #8: 75

Marks:  72 85 67 78 90 81 87 75
Average:  79.4
```

## 03-1: Reverse Output

Create a folder called **ReverseOutput**.  Create a C# program that reads N values into an array and displays it in reverse order.  **Note:** You will need to declare the array **after** the Console.Readline() line.  Here is example of how your program might run.

```csharp
Input the number of elements to store in the array :3
Input 3 elements in the array :
element - 0 : 2
element - 1 : 5
element - 2 : 7

The values stored in the array (in reverse order) are:
7 5 2
```

## 03-2: Copying Elements Array-to-Array in Reverse Order

Create a folder called **ArrayCopyReverse**.  Create a program in C# Sharp to copy the elements in one array into another array, but in reverse order.  Here is example of how your program might run.

```csharp
Input the number of elements to be stored in the array :3
Input 3 elements in the array :
element - 0 : 15
element - 1 : 10
element - 2 : 12

The elements stored in the first array are :
15 10 12
The elements copied into the second array are :
12 10 15
```

## 03-03: Maximum and Minimum Elements in an Array

Create a folder called **MaxMinElementsArray*.  Write a program in C# Sharp to find maximum and minimum element in an array.  Here is example of how your program might run.
```csharp
Input the number of elements to be stored in the array :3
Input 3 elements in the array :
element - 0 : 45
element - 1 : 25
element - 2 : 21

Maximum element is : 45
Minimum element is : 21
```
