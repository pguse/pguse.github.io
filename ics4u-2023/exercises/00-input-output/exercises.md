# Input-Output

In these exercises you will use the **Console.WriteLine()** function to perform text output, the **Console.ReadLine()** function to get text input, and three variables to store three pieces of information.  You have also seen how to output the value of a variable within a string using the **Console.WriteLine()** function.  See the **Program.cs** file above for an example of how to use these functions.

## Exercises:

## 00-1:  Hello World

1.  **Initialize a C# Project**

    * Open the command prompt ***(or terminal)***
    * Navigate to the folder where you'd like to create the C# project
    * Type **dotnet new console**
    * This creates a **Program.cs** file in your folder with a simple **"Hello World"** program already written
2.  When a project folder is first opened in **VS Code**, a notification will appear at the top of the window asking if you'd like to add the required assets to build and debug your project.  Select **Yes**
3.  Run the **"Hello World"** program by typing **dotnet run** in the command prompt ***(or terminal)***

## 00-2:  Three Question Survey

Create a new folder called **Survey** for your project and then create a new console app template.  Now modify the file to do the following:
* Prompt the user with the following three questions:
    * **What is your name?**
    * **How old are you?**
    * **What month were you born in?**
* Save the answers to the three questions using three variables.
* Output the answers back into the console using clear language.
